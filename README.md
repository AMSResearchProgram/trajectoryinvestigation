# trajectoryinvestigation
This repository contains scripts for cleaning trajectory data and traffic simulation models developed as part of the FHWA Trajectory Investigation project. 

DataCleaningScripts includes scripts helpful for cleaning vehicle trajectory data. This corresponds to Chapter 3 of the Trajectory Investigation for Enhanced Calibration of Microsimulation Models final report. 

VISSIMCalibrationScripts includes scripts and files helful for conducting trajectory calibration in VISSIM. This corresponds with Appendix A of the Trajectory Investigation for Enhanced Calibration of Microsimulation Models final report. 

AIMSUNCalibrationScripts includes scripts and files helpful for conducting trajectory calibration in Aimsun. This corresponds with Appendix B of the Trajectory Investigation for Enhanced Calibration of Microsimulation Models final report.
